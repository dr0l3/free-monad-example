Model version uses the pattern

sealed trait A[B]
case class C extends A[Unit] or String or something other concrete type

circe cant encode this as json for some reason

Algebra version uses the pattern

sealed trait A[B]
case class C[B] extends A[B]

but this makes writing interpreters quite hard because you have to write interpreters that return the type Id[B] which is hard.

The model version is nice, but clearly not scalable. Imagine having a database algebra where you need a new instruction for every single case class.

It seems like we need shapeless to do some magic here...
